<h1>Reply to Sabine Hossenfelder on the Scientific Method</h1>

<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2015/05/book-review-string-theory-and.html">Sabine's
article and video.</a>

I've thought deeply on this subject and I think the discussion can
be helped by some verbiage. 

<ul>
  <li> Scientific Method Theory - the philosophical arguments underpinning science</li>
  <li> Scientific Process - what scientists do on a day-to-day basis</li>
  <li> Scientific Sociology - how the community decides on a theory</li>
</ul>

Now, the discussion of the Scientific Method Theory that is closest to
my own is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYPapE-3FRw" >this one by Feynman.</a>   My own is:

<ol>
  <li> We generate theories. </li>
  <li> We collect data from experiments. </li>
  <li> We pick the simplest theory that matches the results. </li>
</ol>

Let me go into detail of each of these.

<i>We generate theories</i>.  Each theory is predictive.  In fact,
each theory is a function from the inputs of the experiment to the
results of the experiment.  This is easy to imagine in physics where
the input is the speed of a ball launched into the air and the
predicted result is the time it takes the ball to hit the ground.  It
is harder to see in paleobiology, where the prediction might be that
the next bones dug up are consistent with the existing <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree" >phylogenetic
tree of life</a>.  I leave open the idea that paleobiology, geology,
economics, etc. may use a different scientific method, but for this
discussion all theories are predictive functions.

<i>We collect data from experiments.</i> You may do the experiments
yourself or you may get data from someone you trust.  Trust of the
data is important - scientists often throw out some of their data
because they don't trust it.  Repeatable experiments not only provide
accurate numbers, they provide data that anyone can get without having
to trust someone.  The society of scientists is held together by
trusted data and large shocks happen when that trust fails.

<i>We pick the simplest theory that matches the results.</i> If we run
the ball-in-the-air experiment 100 times with different speeds, we
know that a 100-term polynomial will exactly match our results.  But
our intuition is that that a 3-term polynomial is &quot;better&quot;,
even though it doesn't exactly match the data.  The 3-term polynomial
is simpler, a concept that can be quantified using <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory"
 >Algorithmic Information Theory</a>.  Essentially, the 3-term
polynomial can be encoded in a smaller computer program than the
100-term.  (A quantified version of <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" >Ockham's
razor</a>.)  Thus, statistics tells us how close the theory matches
the data and algorithmic information theory tells us which theory is
simplest.  There can be tradeoffs between the two, but in practice
there a usually few choices and we pick the one that &quot;feels
right&quot;.

That was a quick overview of what I'm calling Scientific Method
Theory.  It's math and philosophy and it spits out a theory.  It's
separate from the Scientific Process, which is what scientists do on a
day-to-day basis, and Scientific Sociology, which is how a community
decides on a theory.

The Scientific Process has a lot of what you'd expect: creating
theories, generating data by running experiments, and using the
Scientific Method Theory to decide which theories are bad and which
are good.  But there's more: evaluating other people's theories,
deciding which experiments to perform, looking at the data from other
people's experiments and deciding whether or not to trust it.

For Scientific Sociology, you really should read the excellent work by
Kuhn.  He goes into how scientists can get spellbound by a collection
of theories, called a <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm#Scientific_paradigm"
 >paradigm</a>, and marginalize another paradigm that is better.  The
new paradigm wins by winning over the younger generation of scientists
and waiting for the old guard to retire.  This &quot;paradigm
shift&quot; can take decades.

Scientific Sociology is interesting, but will play very little role as
I address the issues mentioned by Hossenfelder.

I haven't read Richard Dawid's book.  

Two theories are inconsistent.  &quot;non-empirical theory assessment&quot;

A single theory is not self-consistent.

Theory that suddenly changes its mind.  (wormhole with aliens with
warp drive...)  &quot;limits to scientific underdetermination&quot;

More theory has done for us, the more we trust it.
&quot;meta-inductive inference&quot;

The more surprising a finding is the more we trust it.
&quot;Unexpected explanatory coherence&quot;

string theory only theory  &quot;limits to global sceintific underdetermination&quot;

Some physicists think since we have only one contender for a
final theory that must be the one.  &quot;No alternatives
argument&quot;

Hypothesis Preselection - good conduct, reproducable, peer review,
community standards (math, consistent in region where it is applicable), 

What if we can never observe the inconsistency?


As Feynman says, &quot;If it disagrees with experiment,
it's wrong.&quot;.
