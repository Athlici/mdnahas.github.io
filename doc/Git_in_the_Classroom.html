<h1>Git in the Classroom : my experience and conclusions</h1>

<p> I taught Data Structures to 18 very intelligent teenagers over 3
weeks in the summer of 2015.  We were in a lab with 20 Macs and I
decided that a good way to distributed and collect programming
assignments was using git.  Not only that, but I wanted to give the
students a "real world" experience and using source control fit right
in. </p>

<p> I decided to use a single repository.  (Since the course didn't
have grades, I wasn't very worried about cheating.)  Each student
created their own directory at the top level, along with a
"journal.txt" file so that git would pick up the directory.  Also at
the top level was my directory, which held the assignments, and a
shared directory, which held common files and guides to bash, git,
etc. </p>

<h2> How the class worked without the problems </h2>

<p> The first assignment was to clone the repo, create their own
directory, create the "journal.txt" file, run "git add", "git commit"
and the push the result.  Of course, there were clashes and everyone
had to run "git pull" before they could "git push".  The students soon
figured out it was a race and people cheered when they got their files
in.  It was a large class, so the race dragged on near the end as the
last files were committed. </p>

<p> The class was sharp and realized there had to be a better way.  I
said it worked better if everyone took their turn and did it
one-at-a-time.  I introduced a "conch" (actually a small stuffed
animal) that meant that it was that person's time to push and that we
could quickly check in by passing the conch around the room.  (The
room had all the computers around the edge, so it was easy to pass the
conch from one end to the other.) </p>

<p> From then on, assignments were published by me pushing to the repo
and students pulling.  (This often had the class reminding me to push
to the shared repo, since I often forgot after I had only committed to
my local repo.)  Assignments were turned in by doing the "git pull"
and "git push" around the room.  </p>


<h2> Description of the problems </h2>

<p> The first problem was networking.  The college we were at had
locked down the networks crazy tight.  Machines could not communicate
with each other.  I couldn't even plug my laptop in to an ethernet
port and expect it to work.  I didn't want to use GitHub or BitBucket
because of the program's worries about the students' personal
information.  After 2 days of problems, the IT staff got my laptop on
the network and everything went fine from then on. </p>

<p> Everyone using the same repo was both a blessing and a curse.  One
blessing was that it was simple.  Another blessing was that it
was shared, so group projects were easy to accomidate.  (One half of
the class wrote code, the other half wrote unit tests!)  A curse was
that there were no permissions - it was easy for a student to delete
the assignments from my directory or, when looking at another
student's good result, modify it.  Luckily, this was git, so those
were repairable.  </p>

<p> Another problem was configuration.  Git made it easy to move
students to a different computer, because their code was already
there, but the git config for name and email remained that of the
computer's previous resident.  Also, on the Mac, the default editor
for git was "vm", which is not a friendly editor to newbies.  I had
them change to "nano".  The students were not familiar with git so a
huge block warning from "git pull" about setting the default merge
strategy in git 2.0 went unnoticed for most of the class.  Lastly, I
think making "git pull" default to using rebase would have been better
and would have produced clearer histories when being viewed with
"gitk". </p>

<p> A big problem for me was source code editors.  I didn't know what
ones the classroom would have available and I certainly didn't know
any of the advanced features of Eclipse or the other editors.
Students started on Dr.Java and Textedit, but soon all migrated to
Eclipse, which had good support for JUnit.  Eclipse, if you don't
know, creates all sorts of directories and a ton of files.  If you
Google git and Eclipse, you'll find that there's a git plugin for
Eclipse, but I didn't know how to use it and I wasn't going to
introduce it mid-stream.  I tried adding some stuff to ".gitignore",
but it did no good.  Some students were checking in everything.
Others were checking in nothing.  Those who just did their .java
files, had a huge print out with "git status" that warned them about
all the Eclipse files that they weren't checking in.  All told, it was
a mess that I never figured out how to resolve, but we did eventually
get the students to make sure their .java files were checked in by
running 'find . -name "*.java" -print0 | xargs -0 git add'. </p>

<p> The "git pull"/"git push" around the room worked, but it was slow.
 When it worked, it took 5 minutes because each student did at least 4
 commands: "git add *.java", 'git commit -m "..."', "git pull" and
 "git push".  It also suffered from bad handoffs: someone would push
 and forget to pass the conch or someone wasn't looking for the conch.
 I think a better strategy would be to have everyone do their "git
 commit"s and have a teacher walk around to finalize the "git pull" /
 "git push".  Also, finding a way to do a "git pull" without having to
 write a commit message (does --rebase do that?) would help in a huge
 way.  Then you could have each type the command "git pull; git push"
 and have each run in turn and get it done in 20 seconds.</p>

<p> There were also the usual git problems.  I had a number of
problems with stale hidden message files (e.g., ".git/.MERGE_MSG.swp")
in the .git directory.  The nice thing is that the worst problems
could be resolved by cloning a new copy of the repo, adding the
student's latest changes to that version, and then deleting the
problematic repo. </p>

<p> A pervasive problem was that many students hadn't used the
command-line before.  I had to have a little lesson telling them about
"ls", "cd", "cp", etc.. </p>



<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p> Did it work?  Yes.  Not flawlessly, but it worked. </p>

<p> Would I use it again?  Certainly.  Even with all the problems.
Sharing code with the students and collecting it was easy.  Keeping a
history of everything done was helpful.  No one's code was lost.
Sharing code between students - for the testing assignments or for
group projects - was ideal.  And students got to use a production tool
that they'll see again.</p>

<p> What would you do differently?  First, I'd nail down the editor
and figure out how to keep the repository tidy.  I hated all those
Eclipse files.  I'd also look a little closer at "git push" / "git
pull" to see if I could make the end-of-class checkin faster.  I'd
also look at the variants on "git add" to make sure students didn't
miss files that they should have been adding to their repo.<p>

<p> Another thing I'd do differently is have more discipline about the
layout of the directories and files in the repo.  I had my teaching
assistant run tests on everyone's code and it would have been easier
if he could write a script to find the code for each student's
assignments.</p>

<p> I consider it a success, but not a resounding one.  Certainly if
you worry about cheating, you'll need a more complicated repo
structure.  I know I'll be trying it again the next time I teach.
